This project is my attempt at creating an AI for connect four using Deep Q-learning. The inputs i am feeding the model is the 7x6 grid which is split into two binary maps where 1's in the first one show the agents pieces and 1's in the other shows enemy pieces. The model is then first passed through 2 CNN layers which is followed by a couple of linear layers which then outputs Q vals for the 7 different actions.

I didn't manage to train a working model.
